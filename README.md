# Working_with_Python_Dunder_Methods

### The "__str__" method should be used to return a string that is more suitable for users to read
### ( e.g it can be more descriptive but not have  every little detail of the object)

### The" __repr__" method  should be used to return a string representing the objectsuch that with that string you can re-create the object fully.

### in order to use for loops we need "__getitem__" methods
